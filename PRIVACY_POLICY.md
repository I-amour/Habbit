# Privacy Policy for Habbit

**Last updated: February 10, 2026**

## Overview

Habbit ("the App") is a habit tracking application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the App collects, how it is stored, and your rights.

## Data Collection and Storage

**Habbit does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.** All information you enter into the App is stored exclusively on your device using a local database (SQLite).

The data stored locally on your device includes:

- Habit names, icons, colors, and settings you create
- Completion records (dates and values of habit check-ins)
- Notes you attach to completions
- Streak records and gamification progress (XP, badges, level)
- App preferences (theme, reminder settings)

## No Server Communication

The App does **not**:

- Send any data to external servers
- Require an account or login
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Contain advertising or ad-related tracking
- Share data with third parties
- Collect device identifiers or usage analytics

## Notifications

If you enable reminders, the App uses your device's local notification system to schedule habit reminders. These notifications are processed entirely on your device and no notification data is sent to any server.

## Data Retention

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your data exists only on your device
- Uninstalling the App permanently deletes all associated data
- You can delete individual habits or all data from within the App at any time

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The App stores no personal information and does not communicate with any external services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.
